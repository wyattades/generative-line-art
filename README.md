# Generative Line Art

[Live demo](https://wyattades.github.com/generative-line-art)

A single-page website whose purpose is to programmatically generate line art based off of certain variables. Specifically, the graphics are constructed from an array of lines flowing in the same direction, but with various curves that mimic some 3D surface.

The main inspiration for this project was the line art of Moritz Resl, Martin Gr√∂dl, Karl Crull, and Anders Hoff, who all have had similar concepts, but vary wildly in style.
